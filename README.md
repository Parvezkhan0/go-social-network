# Introduction
This is a mini social network created with golang, gorilla/mux and gorm. I built this to get more familiar with the Go language. 
I also decided to use go template just to get familiar with them. I'll probably go with rest apis for future projects.
I intend to do some refactoring later on, but the functionalities are currently working. Feel free to fork it or make some suggestions to the current implementation.
